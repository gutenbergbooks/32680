<h1>The Worlds of Joe Shannon</h1>

<h2>By Frank M. Robinson</h2>

<h3>Illustrated by Paul Orban</h3>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i1.png" alt="I" width="29" height="50" /></div>
<p>'ll take beer, son, and
thanks again for the offer. As you
can see, I'm kinda down on my
luck. I know what you're thinking,
but I'm not really on the bum. I
usually make out all right&mdash;nothing
fancy, mind you, but it's a living.
Odd jobs in the winter and spring,
follow the harvests in the summer
and fall. Things are slack right now.</p>

<p>You? Electronics, huh? Used to
know a fellow in electronics....</p>

<p>His name was Joe Shannon, used
to work for Stellar Electric up in
Fremont. Young fellow, not more'n
twenty-five or so. Rail thin, wispy
hair, serious look&mdash;you know, the
one suit, absent-minded type. Joe
was a brain. A triple-A, gold-plated,
genuine genius. Had a wife named
Marge. Not beautiful but pretty
and a nice figure and a cook you
never saw the likes of. Like I say,
she was married to Joe but Joe was
married to his work and after you'd
been around a while, you could tell
there was friction.</p>

<p>But that ain't the beginning.</p>

<p>I suppose I'm partly responsible
because it started when I was over
for dinner one night. I had been
working in the garden and doing
odd jobs around the house that
afternoon and I finagled it so I was
invited for supper. Marge Shannon
made chili that I just couldn't stay
away from. Thick with beans and
meat and easy on the spices so it
wouldn't burn an old man's stomach.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img class="img1" src="images/image_1.png" width="500" height="768" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Joe and I had just gone into the
living room&mdash;Marge stayed in the
kitchen to do the dishes&mdash;and I was
feeling stuffed and kinda sleepy. All
of a sudden Joe says out of a clear
blue sky: "Harry, this is a hell of a
world we live in, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Now Joe had never struck me as
being the unhappy type. He loved
his work, he loved his wife (and
just about in that order), and so far
as I knew he didn't owe any money.
So I tried to feel him out, to find
out where the rub was.</p>

<p>"There's nothing wrong with the
world, Joe," I says. "It's just the
people in it."</p>

<p>He started methodically filling
his pipe and tamping down the tobacco
and not saying a word and I
get the feeling that he's deadly
serious about something.</p>

<p>"You're right," he says quietly.
"It isn't the world, it's the people."</p>

<p>I sit there feeling puzzled but a
lot less sleepy and finally I ask:
"Anything wrong, Joe?"</p>

<p>He lights his pipe and settles back
in the big, overstuffed easy chair
with the flowered slip-cover that
Marge made, still frowning. "It's
an unhappy world," he repeats.</p>

<p>"It all depends on what side of
the picture you want to look at," I
says, trying to cheer him up. "Maybe
you been reading too many newspaper
headlines."</p>

<p>Joe wasn't listening. "What
makes people unhappy, Harry?"</p>

<p>Now, son, there's a million things
that make people unhappy. Given
half the night, I could maybe list a
couple of hundred. But to narrow
it down to one or two, I couldn't do
it. So I just shook my head and let
Joe carry the ball.</p>

<p>"It's a complex world, Harry. A
lot of people never adjust to it.
Some of them turn the tables and
try to adjust the world to them,
which makes a lot of other people
unhappy. No, I'd say there's a certain
number of people who just
don't fit in this world of ours. Maybe
at a different time and on another
world, they might fit. But
they don't fit on this one, not right
here and now."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/t3.png" alt="T" width="47" height="50" /></div>
<p>hat was a way of looking at
it that I had never thought of
before. And Joe had a point. Now
you take old Barney Muhlenberg,
the town drunk. I knew Barney
when he was a boy, and a more
sober, adventure-seeking young rascal
you never saw. But by then all
the frontiers had dried up, it was
between wars, and the only adventure
Barney could find was in the
bottom of a bottle. Barney was one
of those poor folks born fifty years
too late.</p>

<p>Or you take Miss Alice Markey,
the history teacher at Fremont
High. She's an old spinster&mdash;frail,
white-haired, and a little bit crabby
now. You'd never believe it but she
used to be the romantic type. Somehow,
the right man just never came
along, but she's never given up hoping
either.</p>

<p>Sure, you wouldn't believe it to
look at them. But that's how people
are, down underneath. All dreams
and wishful thinking.</p>

<p>"It's tough, Joe," I says, "but
what can you do about it?"</p>

<p>It always seemed to me that
you weren't going to help people by
letting them fall asleep on a couch
at fifty dollars a nap and trying to
convince them they should give up
their dreams.</p>

<p>"You've got to give people something
<i>positive</i>!" Joe says, hitting an
end table with his fist so an ashtray
jumps off.</p>

<p>I sat up and began to take notice.
Once Joe had an idea, he usually
did something about it.</p>

<p>"You got something in mind," I
accused.</p>

<p>He stopped pacing and pointed
his pipe at me like it was the working
end of a twenty-two rifle. "I got
an idea, Harry," he says, the genius
showing in his eyes like the dollar
signs in a cash register. "I'm going
to make a machine during my vacation
and...."</p>

<p>And then Marge is in the doorway,
dishtowel in her hand and
little anger spots in her cheeks.
"Joseph Shannon!" she says, stamping
her foot. "You know perfectly
well what we're going to do and
where we're going to go on your
vacation!"</p>

<p>Joe's mouth got set and I could
see a storm blowing up so I struggled
to my feet and got my hat.
"That was awful nice chili, Missus
Shannon," I says, and it isn't much
more than two seconds later when
I'm out the front door and walking
up the sidewalk.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/w4.png" alt="W" width="75" height="50" /></div>
<p>ell, Joe&mdash;stubborn Irishman
that he was&mdash;stayed
right in town during his vacation.
He had a laboratory in the basement
and every day when I went by
I could hear him and Wally Claus,
his assistant, working down there,
hammering and nailing and running
electric motors that spat sparks
and whined worse'n two alley cats
fightin' in a fish market.</p>

<p>On the day that it's finished, Joe
invites me over for dinner again.
After the meal's over&mdash;and Joe's so
anxious that he don't even tell
Marge how nice the tuna fish casserole
was&mdash;we go down into the
basement. Marge doesn't come
along.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with
Marge?" I ask. "Ain't she interested?"</p>

<p>Joe jams his hands in his pockets,
scowls, and says: "We've been having
a little trouble, Harry. She
doesn't see things my way."</p>

<p>It isn't any of my business so I
clam up and walk over to where
the whole front half of the basement
is curtained off with a couple
of old sheets and a drawstring.</p>

<p>"This is it," Joe says proudly,
pulling on the drawstring. "The
greatest invention since the wheel!"</p>

<p>Well, to tell you the truth, son, I
was kinda disappointed. I had expected
something big and shiny but
what there was looked a little like a
cross between a phone booth and
one of those things in train stations
where you take your own photograph.
I looked inside and all I
could see was a big screen in front,
like on a television set, a coin slot,
and a funny looking hat with a
cable leading out of it.</p>

<p>"It's real nice," I says, not actually
knowing whether it was or not.
"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I call it a <i>Paradise</i> booth," Joe
says.</p>

<p>I took another look at the machine,
and then looked at Joe. It
occurs to me that maybe he's been
working too hard or that arguments
with Marge have sorta unsettled
him.</p>

<p>"Look, Harry," Joe says, "remember
when we were talking
about all the people who didn't fit
in this world?"</p>

<p>"Sure I remember," I says.
"What's this got to do with it?"</p>

<p>"What if people could choose
the type of world they wanted to
live in?"</p>

<p>I looks at him blankly. "I don't
get it."</p>

<p>He fishes around for his pipe and
lights up. "How big's the universe,
Harry?"</p>

<p>"Now son, I got no idea how big
the universe is and I says so. All I
know is that it's <i>big</i>."</p>

<p>"Most scientists say the universe
is infinite," Joe explains. "And if it's
infinite, then it must have an infinite
number of worlds in it. An
actual world to match whatever
kind of world you can dream up,
let's say. All you have to do is step
into the <i>Paradise</i> booth, put on the
cap, visualize the kind of world you
want to live in so it shows on the
screen, and off you go!"</p>

<p>"You're kidding," I says feebly.
"You don't really mean it."</p>

<p>He taps me on the chest with his
finger and says: "Yes, I do really
mean it, Harry. I've tried it and it
works!"</p>

<p>And there I thought I had him.
"If you went off to another world,"
I says slyly, "just how did you get
back?"</p>

<p>"Built myself another machine,"
he says promptly.</p>

<p>I snapped the trap shut. "Just
picked this world out of all the millions
there are? Just like that."</p>

<p>Joe grinned. "I just thought of
the damnedest world that I could,
and here I was!"</p>

<p>Well, he had me. There wasn't
much more I could say. Joe's idea,
of course, was to build machines
and put them on the street corners
like you would newspaper stands.
He figured that all the misfits and
the unhappy people would sneak
out and use them and <i>whisht</i>, off
they'd fly to their own favorite
world, leaving all us well-adjusted
people behind. He even had a slogan
figured out. "<i>Paradise&mdash;for
only a quarter!</i>"</p>

<p>You see, he figured he'd have to
charge a quarter not only to pay
for the machines but because people
are just naturally suspicious of
anything they get for free....</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/j5.png" alt="J" width="38" height="50" /></div>
<p>oe and Wally Claus rigged
up three of the machines and
installed them on some of the better
known street corners around Fremont.
Joe had trouble getting a license
to do it, but when he told the
city fathers what the machines did,
they figured the best way to discourage
a crackpot was to let him
go ahead and flop on his own.</p>

<p>And he came close to doing it.
Those booths just sat on the street
corners all summer and gathered
dust. People called them Shannon's
folly, which didn't help things with
Marge any.</p>

<p>And then one day, Barney Muhlenberg
disappeared. We thought
he might have gotten drunk and
fallen in the river and we spent a
good two days dragging it. And
then we looked in at his rooming
house but we didn't find a thing except thirty-nine empty bottles and a
rusty opener.</p>

<p>It was Joe who first discovered
what had happened. He got hold of
me and we went down to the <i>Paradise</i>
booth on the corner just opposite
from Schultz's Bar and Grill.
There was a quarter in the coin till
and when I looked at the screen,
I knew Barney had taken off.</p>

<p>Well, everybody's happy. Joe's
glad that his machine has finally
caught on, Barney is probably happy
playing Cowboys and Indians
even though he's way too old for it,
and the town is happy because its
worst sanitary problem has just
eliminated itself.</p>

<p>The news gets spread around and
everybody starts laying odds on
who's gonna be the next to go. Nobody
goes near the booths for about
a week, and then the kids start passing
around a rumor Saturday morning
that Miss Alice Markey has submitted
her resignation to the school
board and is packing to leave town.</p>

<p>The town splits. Half the people
figure she'll be sensible and leave by
bus. The other half, myself included,
station ourselves at the
<i>Paradise</i> booth that's nearest to her
apartment. Along about noon, Miss
Alice shows up. She's pale and determined
looking, all dressed up to
travel. Her suitcase is leaking little
bits and ends of clothing and over
her shoulder she's got a knapsack
with her lunch in it. Always practical,
Miss Alice was.</p>

<p>"You aren't really thinking of
leaving are you, Ma'm?" I ask,
thinking it would be a shame for a
good-hearted, hard-working school
teacher like Miss Alice to leave Fremont.</p>

<p>"I'll thank you to mind your own
business, young man!" she says
coldly, and marches into the booth
and pulls the curtain shut. A moment
later I hear a coin drop,
there's a flash of bright blue light,
and then dead silence.</p>

<p>I was the nearest one so I lifts the
curtain and peeks in. Miss Alice
and her suitcase and knapsack have
disappeared. I look at the screen
even though nobody needs to tell
me that Miss Alice Markey has
whisked off to a world where all
the men look like Rudolph Valentino
and have a fondness for old-maid
school teachers. Sure enough,
I was right....</p>

<p>About mid-August, Joe comes
around and he's looking mighty
worried. "Harry," he says, "Wally
Claus has disappeared."</p>

<p>I mull it over for a minute. "It
can't be what you're thinking," I
says. "Wally's one of the most normal
men in town."</p>

<p>We go down to see Wally's wife
and I begin to get the picture.
Wally was one of those hard working,
hard drinking Dutchmen with
a family about three times as big as
his salary. He worked at Stellar
Electric with Joe and, like I say,
sometimes he used to help Joe in his
lab.</p>

<p>"When was the last time you saw
Wally?" Joe asks gently.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wally is blubbering in her
handkerchief and trying to hold a
kid on her lap at the same time.
Two more are hanging onto her
chair, and about six others are
standing around the room sucking
their thumbs and looking wide-eyed
at Joe and me.</p>

<p>"It was p-payday," she blurts, the
tears streaming down her fat cheeks.
"Wally c-comes home drunk and
all I do was quietly ask him for his
paycheck. And that's the last I see
of him. I d-don't know w-what got
into him!"</p>

<p>Anybody with half an eye, I
thought, could piece together what
had happened. Wally probably had
one or two at Schultz's bar and got
to feeling sorry for himself and then
when he got home, he walked into
a hornet's nest. Nine kids bawling
or running around and Mrs. Wally
nagging the life out of him. He
must have wondered if it was worth
it, then found a quarter in his
pocket and walked around the corner
to the nearest <i>Paradise</i> booth.
<i>Whisht</i>&mdash;and Wally's worries are a
thing of the past.</p>

<p>Joe and I get the idea at the
same time and we chase down to
the nearest booth. I took one look
at the screen and blushed. Wally
had some pretty wild ideas.</p>

<p>On the way home, I tried to talk
Joe into tearing the machines down.
"How do you know where it's going
to end, Joe?" I argues. "You can't
tell who's well-adjusted and who
isn't any more. And besides, some
of those who ain't have contributed
just as much to life as those who
are. Maybe even more."</p>

<p>"I'm going to leave them up,"
Joe says grimly. "The world will be
better off without a lot of neurotics
running around."</p>

<p>"You won't think it over, Joe?"</p>

<p>"No," he says, "and to prove it,
I'm going to spend the next two
weeks in New York looking for
backing to put up <i>Paradise</i> booths
all across the country."</p>

<p>"What does Marge think?" I ask.</p>

<p>"Hang Marge!" he says.</p>

<p>Well, I just stood there in the
middle of the block and watched
him get smaller and smaller in the
distance. I couldn't think of anything
more to say and he wouldn't
have listened to me anyways.</p>

<p>I packed and left town that same
night. The strawberry season was
just coming on and I ain't never
missed a harvest yet.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/a7.png" alt="A" width="50" height="50" /></div>
<p>bout two weeks passed
and I couldn't stay away any
longer. I got back to town, took a
look around, and then went down
to the station to wait for Joe to
come in on the flyer. I figured somebody
ought to be there to break it to
him gently.</p>

<p>He gets off the train looking happy
and successful and I figure he's
made arrangements to put a <i>Paradise</i>
booth in every city, town, and
crossroads in the nation.</p>

<p>"Why, hello, Harry," he says
when he sees me, and gives me the
old professional smile and handshake
that really ain't the old Joe
at all. "Any cabs around?"</p>

<p>"No, there ain't no cabs around."</p>

<p>Something in the way I says it
makes him give me a sharp look.
"How come? There's always a couple
to meet the flyer."</p>

<p>"There ain't none this time," I
says. "No cab drivers."</p>

<p>"No cab drivers?"</p>

<p>"Ain't no need for 'em any
more," I says. "Ain't no people in
town to use cabs. Town's empty.
Everybody's gone."</p>

<p>He looks kinda green and says:
"What do you mean, everybody's
gone?"</p>

<p>I shrugs and starts walking back
to town. "Everybody took off," I
says. "Your <i>Paradise</i> booths were
real popular."</p>

<p>He still looks blank so I give it
to him straight. I had first thought
about it when Wally Claus disappeared.
It occurs to me then that
everybody has times when they wish
they could crawl out from under
and quietly disappear. You see, Joe
had assumed that some people were
adjusted to society and some
weren't. Well, actually <i>nobody</i> is,
it's just a difference of degree.</p>

<p>Once Wally took off, it sorta
burst the dam. More and more people
sneaked into the booths,
dropped in a quarter, and <i>whisht</i>&mdash;they
were a billion miles away.</p>

<p>It was lonely and dark in town.
No street lamps, of course. There
was nobody down at the power
plant to work the switches. And
there weren't any lights in the
houses 'cause there wasn't anybody
around.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine <i>everybody</i> going,"
Joe says, biting his lip. "What
about all the kids?"</p>

<p>"I kinda think they were among
the first," I says. I waves at the
starry sky. "There's probably a
planet up there some place where
there's nothing but hot rods and
football stadiums. And I suppose
there's one section of the universe
fenced off for all the Junior Spacemen
that'll be roaming around it."</p>

<p>Anybody you could think of
mighta had a reason for leaving, I
told him. The boys at Schultz's
probably took off for a world where
Marilyn Monroe has a thousand
twin sisters; and Johnny Douglas,
the ace at Kelly's Bowling Alley, is
probably located on a world where
it's impossible to bowl anything but
a three hundred game.</p>

<p>By then, we were in front of Joe's
house. It was as dark and curtained
as the others.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/t8.png" alt="T" width="48" height="50" /></div>
<p>he house was empty. The
blinds had been drawn, the
dishes neatly stacked and put away,
and a note left on the doorstoop
telling the milkman not to bring
any more milk.</p>

<p>The note to Joe was on the kitchen
table. It was hard for Joe to read
on accounta it was blurred in spots
where Marge had been crying and
the tears had fallen on the paper.
It told Joe&mdash;among a whole mess of
other things&mdash;that she thought she
had married a man, not a radio set,
and since everybody was using them
she was going to visit a <i>Paradise</i>
booth that night.</p>

<p>"What am I going to do?" Joe
asks remorsefully.</p>

<p>"That's your problem," I says
heartlessly, thinking of all the chili
dinners that went with Marge.
"You made the booths in the first
place."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I know." He pulls out a
wad of papers from his pocket and
thumbs through them. "I got contracts
here for a <i>Paradise</i> booth in
every town over five thousand population.
I could be a millionaire in
a month."</p>

<p>"Joe," I says, suddenly frightened,
"don't do it. Look what happened
here in Fremont. Why man,
if you put those things all over the
country there wouldn't be a soul
left in the United States after a
month had gone by."</p>

<p>"You're right, Harry," he says.
"Absolutely right." And he takes a
cigarette lighter out of his pocket
and sets fire to the papers and lets
them burn 'til they're nothing but
ashes.</p>

<p>"What are you gonna do with the
booths in town?" I ask.</p>

<p>He goes down to the basement
and comes up with a hatchet.
"Come on," he says grimly. "I'll
show you what I'm going to do with
them!"</p>

<p>The first two we chop in small
pieces until the walk is covered with
cogs and wheels and smashed tubes
and dials. We stop at the third one.
That was the fanciest one of all,
with the leather upholstery inside
and the big red neon sign on top
that you could read halfway across
town.</p>

<p>Joe stares at it for a long minute,
then makes up his mind. He fishes
around in his pocket for a coin.</p>

<p>"What do you think you're going
to do?" I asks, alarmed.</p>

<p>"I'm going to look for Marge,"
he says. "I need a vacation anyways."</p>

<p>"How you gonna find her, Joe?"
I asks. "You don't even know what
kind of a world to look for!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," Joe says wistfully.
"It'll be the kind of world where
Marge always wanted to spend a
vacation. Some place like up in
Massachusetts during the summer.
White beaches, little wooden
houses, fishing boats and lobster
pots.... She's described it to me so
often I could picture it down to the
last pebble on the beach."</p>

<p>He gets into the booth.</p>

<p>"Think you'll ever be back, Joe?"
I asks.</p>

<p>He drops a quarter in the coin
slot and a picture builds up on the
screen of a beach with a little town
in the distance.</p>

<p>"Sure," Joe says confidentially.
"We'll be back." And then there's a
flash of blue light and Joe's gone,
too.</p>

<p>I hung around for a couple of
days afterward but Joe and Marge
never came back. I think he found
her all right but Marge didn't want
anything to do with the old world
so they just stayed there.</p>

<p>And that's about all there is, son.
Except I've often wondered what
happened when strangers drove
through and found Fremont a ghost
town....</p>

<p>Now, lookahere, son, it's no cause
for you to go calling me a liar just
because you never heard of Stellar
Electric and Fremont ain't listed on
any map you've got. You didn't expect
me to stay behind when
everybody else had left, did you? I
always had a hankerin' for a different
type of world, too.</p>

<p>A world where a body didn't
have to work so blamed hard and
total strangers would be willin' to
listen to my stories and buy me a
beer....</p>
